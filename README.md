# TT-Advance

This is an Tournament Tracker Application using many features of C#. When I have time, I will refactor more.

To open in your pc (use .csv instead of SQL) change the "value" section of _TrackerUI_WFA\App.config <add key="filePath" value=""/>_ to your desired address to create .csv files.
