# TT-Advance

This is an Tournament Tracker Application using many features of C#. When I have time, I will refactor more.

To open in your pc (use .csv instead of SQL) change the "value" section of TrackerUI_WFA\App.config |add key="filePath" value="'Write your adress here'"| to your desired address to create .csv files.
